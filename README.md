# Caesar Cipher Encryption
One	 of	 the	 oldest	 known	encryption	 techniques	is	 the	Caesar	cipher,	attributed	 to	 Julius	
Caesar.	 It	 involves	 replacing	 each	 letter	 in	 a	 message	 with	 another	 letter	 that	 is	 a	 fixed	
number	of	positions	later	in	the	alphabet.	(If	the	replacement	would	go	past	the	letter	X,	the	
cipher	“wrap	around”	to	the	begging	of	the	alphabet.	For	example,	if	each	letter	is	replaced	
by	the	letter	two	positions	after	it,	then	Y	would	be	replaced	by	A	,	and	Z	would	be	replaced	
by	B.)	  
  
  (a)	Write	a	program	that	encrypts	a	message	using	a	Caesar	cipher.	The	user	will	enter	the	
message	 to	be	encrypted	and	 the	 shift	amount	 (the	number	 of	positions	by	which	letters	
should	be	shifted):  
  *Enter	message	to	be	encrypted:	Go	ahead,	make	my	day.  
Enter	shift	amount	(1-25):3  
Encrypted	message:	Jr	dkhdg,	pdnh	pb	gdb.*
